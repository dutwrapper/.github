## FAQ

### Can I port back .NET/.NET Core project to .NET Framework?
- Yes, you can port back, but you need to do that manually. I don't provide .NET Framework version anymore.

### Branch in dutwrapper?
- `main` or `stable`: Default branch and main release.
- `draft`: This branch will used for update my progress and it is unstable. Use it at your own risk.

### I received error about login while running AccountTest?
- Did you mean this error: `dut_account environment variable not found. Please, add or modify this environment in format "username|password"`?
- If so, you will need to add environment variable named `dut_account` with syntax `studentid|password`. This will ensure secure when testing project.
